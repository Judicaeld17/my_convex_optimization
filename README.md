# Welcome to My Convex Optimization
***

## Task
What is the problem? And where is the challenge?
This project aim is to master convex optimization. 
Indeed, the main challenge here is to understant mathecatical concept 
so it will be easi to transform them in code in order to resolve problems

## Description
How have you solved the problem?
Regarding the aim of the project which is to master how to optimize a convex function we 
perform the following tasks.

First, we define a function and his derivative in python and plot the function.
In addition , we wrote some functions to find the root or the zero of a function.
Then, we use gradient descent algorithm to find the minimum of a function. In this 
gradient descent python function that we wrote we used the function to be minimized derivative.
